# The Lithium's Laboratory

![Laboratory](http://i.imgur.com/08Omtoe.png)

[Lithium](http://lithify.me) is a fast, flexible and must have RAD development framework for PHP 5.3+. You can find more informations about this awesome framework on the [official github repository](https://github.com/UnionOfRAD/lithium).

## Do experiments, try, and merge !

So this laboratory is essentially a place for chemists who want to manipulate atoms and looking for new awesome molecules for Lithium.

**Before continuing, we must warn of the possible discovering of explosive molecules here**

So to take full profits of researchs, an good knowledge of the Lithium core is greatly advisable.

But like all experimental researchs, the discoveries may or may not be a part of Lithium, only depends on you. So modifications on methods names or inner logic can change once merged (if merged) on the official Lithium repository.

## You want in ?

You are dreaming of something awesome for Lithium ? Don't wait anymore and post an issue right now !

## How to test ?

We are experimenting a new framework app structure for building application. [Clone it](https://github.com/jails/li3_bigbang) and start the adventure !

# Branches

## 0) The master branch

The master branch is somehow a compilations of all patches. Don't expect to fetch any of this branches. They are all push forced to keep the maintenance simpler.

## 1) The patch/laboratory branch

The current laboratory is currently focosed on the data abstract level. Works are done to bring the following feature:
- HABTM support (using through implementation). --done--
- Save all behavior. --done--
- Mongo relations. --work in progress--
